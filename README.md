## Features

### Message stream

The message stream is a real-time messaging feature that allows users to engage in interactive conversations with the AI model. As you type your message, the AI responds almost instantly, offering a seamless and fluid chat experience. The message stream also supports rich text formatting, emoji, and media attachments for an engaging communication experience.

### Conversation trees

Zik supports conversation trees, which enable users to branch out and explore different conversation paths with the AI. This feature allows you to create and manage multiple topics within a single conversation, making it easy to switch between subjects and navigate complex discussions. Conversation trees can be expanded, collapsed, and navigated easily, providing an organized and efficient way to interact with the AI model.

### Chat History

Zik automatically saves chat history, enabling users to revisit past conversations and pick up where they left off. This feature is helpful for tracking progress, reviewing previous interactions, and finding important information quickly. Users can search, filter, and sort the chat history by date, keywords, or conversation topics to easily locate specific messages or sections of interest.

### Plugins Managment

Zik's plugin support allows developers to create and integrate custom functionality and features into the chat interface. This extensibility enhances the user experience by enabling specialized applications, such as natural language processing, sentiment analysis, or domain-specific knowledge integration. The plugin management system makes it easy to install, update, and remove plugins as needed, ensuring a modular and customizable AI communication platform.
