## Getting Started with Zik

it out with the OpenAI models currently supported. Alternatively, you can also
clone the Zik repository and run it locally using `docker-compose`, if you have
GPT4ALL installed, it should work out of the box.

### Cloning the Repository

To clone the Zik repository, you need to have Git and Docker installed on your
machine. Once you have installed Git and Docker, you can follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone
   the repository.
2. Type the following command in the terminal:
   `git clone https://github.com/zik-sh/zik.sh.git`
3. Once the repository has been cloned, navigate to the `zik.sh` directory and
   run `docker-compose up`.
